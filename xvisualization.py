Multiple Aspect Trajectory Data Mining Tool Library

The present application offers a tool, to support the user in the classification task of multiple aspect trajectories, specifically for extracting and visualizing the movelets, the parts of the trajectory that better discriminate a class. It integrates into a unique platform the fragmented approaches available for multiple aspects trajectories and in general for multidimensional sequence classification into a unique web-based and python library system. Offers both movelets visualization and a complete configuration of classification experimental settings.
